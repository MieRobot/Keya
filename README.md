Keya is inspired by nature, Keya is inspired by creations and Keya is licensed under creative commons as IoT plant and robot which you can use and modify for free. Keya is a twitter-ing plant who can tweet when she needs water. The design of the robotic plant is powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller and has a ethernet shield attached which in turn connects to the router you have at home via a CAT5 Cable. She knows the soil moisture and temperature via two sensors using the I/O pins of the microcontroller. 
​
She is coded in C++ and has a modular calls which makes use easy to configure. Just change the twitter authorzation code and she is ready to go. She send a tweet every 30 min giving her followers the daily status of her environment. There is a huge scope for improving Keya and using her other I/O ports you can provide more sensor power to her. She can be also upgraded to send sms or just anything. Imagination is the only limitation.
